**Best Ways to Communicate**
________________________
Slack, Jira or GitHub. 
You can feel free to DM, no need to say hello! just write down what you need.
I'll respond asap so pleae leave me details/context about what is needed, and let me have time to process so I can
answer properly. 
I also prefer have a 5-10 minutes Zoom call and summarize it, instead of a long Slack corresponding.
